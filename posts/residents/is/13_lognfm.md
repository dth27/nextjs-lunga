about1: "Radio Gufan’s lognfm is found where the signal is weak. In the interference between two sounds, in the limits of a desired signal. For Lunga 2024, we invite you to join 'music is like music to our ears' in our effort to explore these subtle waves. A thought, a mix, a story, a field recording, a moment - all audio is accepted. More information at radiogufan.is/music-is-like/. We’d be blessed by your contribution."
about2: "Sam released a debut podcast series in 2023 called There Are No Greater Heroes, which tells the story of cult band Tony, Caro & John and their strange musical survival. Over the summer of 2024, Sam is releasing his second documentary series called Sonic Fields, A 7-part podcast which tells the story of a year-long deep dive into the British Music Festival. Sam meets the people and learns about the forces that have shaped the story since the late '60s, before taking a dizzying summer adventure across festivals of today and trying to find his place within it all, and now at LungA."
