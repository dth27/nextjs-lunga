artist: "Coby Sey"
about1: "Coby Sey is a songwriter, producer, vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and DJ, who, after years spent buzzing around the DIY artist circuitry of South East London, has developed a distinctive presence as an artist and performer."
about2: "Coby’s recorded work spans the realms of live instrumentation, sample-based productions and experimental music, melding recognisable motifs of hip-hop, noise, jazz and grime into a dubbed-out anaesthesia. 
On stage, the dreamlike compositions are imbued with a heavy, uneasy dancefloor energy, and fleshed out by live instrumentation courtesy of his revolving band of close South East London cohorts including Alpha Maid, Ben Vince, Charlie Hope, CJ Calderwood and Momoko “MettaShiba” Gill."
about3: "Coby’s open-door approach to sharing and making music is evident in his long-term collaborations with Mica Levi and Tirzah, as well as with Speakers Corner Quartet, Klein, TYSON, Laurel Halo and more. He is also a founding member of London’s CURL collective (with Mica and Brother May), and hosts a monthly radio show on NTS since 2015, offering a peek into his appealingly murky musical world.
Coby’s long awaited debut album ‘Conduit’ was released in September 2022  through AD 93."
