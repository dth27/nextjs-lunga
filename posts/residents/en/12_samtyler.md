Over the summer of 2024, Sam is releasing his second documentary series called Sonic Fields, A 7-part podcast which tells the story of a year-long deep dive into the British Music Festival. Sam meets the people and learns about the forces that have shaped the story since the late '60s, before taking a dizzying summer adventure across festivals of today and trying to find his place within it all, and now at LungA."
