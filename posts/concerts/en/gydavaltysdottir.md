descr1: Gyda Valtýsdóttir has been active as a musician since her early teens as a founding member of the experimental pop-group múm. Classically trained but untamed, Gyda has made music for films, installations, dance, among many other creative ventures, possessing a rare range of musical experiences which creates a unique alchemical compound. Her music emerges from the fluidity of time & genres, dissolving any boundaries by simply not sensing their existence. Her cello playing, always inventive and highly personal, underlines a dignified craftsmanship while flirting with sensitivity & strength.
