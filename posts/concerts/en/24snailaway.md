descr1:  Landing from a fascination for syncopated drum patterns and ecstatic hypnotism, snailaway is dedicated to bringing sweat and joy to the dance floor. Her psychedelic cross-overs are a contagious form of effervescent editing through storytelling and somatic trance. Since 2022 they are a resident at MONO M0b1le in Rotterdam NL. Let’s Move
