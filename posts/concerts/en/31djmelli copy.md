descr1:  'DJ Mellí made her first impression on the scene in 2016 and since then has been dubbed as the “crossover queen” of Reykjavík’s nightlife. She does not limit herself to any music genre or style and with tight sets and signature drag-esque glamour look, she gives the nightlife a pop of colour it needs. Throwing down funk hits to trap bangers and everything in between, she makes sure you will not want to leave the dancefloor simply because it’s just too damn good.'
