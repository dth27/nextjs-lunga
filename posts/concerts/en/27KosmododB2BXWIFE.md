id: 27
id2: 27b
stage: Skaftfell Bistró
time: Saturday
descr1:  "Our sensors have detected an unusual energy surge. On approach, we identify the source as a unique cosmic event. It's a back-to-back sonic clash between two entities: Kosmodod and XWIFE. Kosmodod, an entity known in this quadrant for over a decade, founder of the Sweaty Records outpost, and purveyor of underground electro frequencies."
descr2: 'Next to Kosmodod, we have XWIFE, a lifeform originated from the planet Iceland. Their transmission: an unpredictable selection of fast-paced, obscure aptitude for genre-jumping sound waves. Recognized for their commitment to local sound clusters, co-founding Radio Gufan. 
descr3: Together, these two are ready to engage your auditory systems with a powerful energy field that reverberates across all frequencies. Brace for impact; it’s time to go where no ear has gone before. End Starlog.'
