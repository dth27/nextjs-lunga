descr1: When you boil it down, Hjaltalín is essentially a group of talented friends. They were high-school students when they started playing together. Today they are professional composers, producers, songwriters, performers, players (and a pilot!) who have made the band their labour of love for nearly twenty years.
descr2: With 4x studio albums, a soundtrack and a live album with the Icelandic symphony orchestra under their belt and multiple Icelandic Music Awards you could say that the best of the Hjaltalín batch sound like they've been around for ages; they are weathered – classic. After being on hiatus for nearly five years Hjaltalín returns specifically to perform at this year's LungA.
