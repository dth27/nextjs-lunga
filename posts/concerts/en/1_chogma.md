descr1: "CHÖGMA is a new Icelandic progressive-metal band. Using detuned and extended instruments the band creates songs that are as freakishly fast as they are heavy. From a soft angelic voice to inhumanly high notes and to low, heavy metal screams, Elísabet Mörk, Chögma's singer, sings her Icelandic-only lyrics as they mix in with a soothing keyboard performance by Kári Kresfelder to the rythm of Jónatan Sigþórsson's jazz inspired drumming with super-fast bass drumbeats. Finally, guitarplayer Jakob Kristjánsson and Stefán Ingi Ingvarsson on bass fill in the gaps with quick and complicated technical tricks, and the bands distinctive 'Chögging'."
descr2: "With the assistance of Jónatan Sigþórsson, the band was founded by Jakob Kristjánsson in the autumn of 2023, due to a sudden need to compete in Músíktilraunir, one of Icelands biggest music competitions. By making a few phone calls the band Chögma was formed, and before they knew it, they had won third place in Músíktilraunir."
