descr1:  In an era where songs and even albums are churned out in a matter of a couple of weeks, it’s notable that Iceland-based, Ivory Coast-born musician Snny says his biggest inspiration for his debut album “Water is Styled in Honey” is a movie that took 11 years to make.
descr2: '“Something that really influenced me was Richard Linklater’s film Boyhood, just because of the process that went into making that and how patient he was shooting it over the course of [so many] years.”
Using the record to explore the potency of familial advice–even when it’s fictitious–jives with the theme of nostalgia that Snny says he’s explored in his previous EPs, 2020’s Otito and 2017’s Learning to Swim. But it also represents the realization of a creative vision he’s had for years. “It’s the type of music I wanted to make when I was making Otito and I just wasn’t at a place where I could do that yet,” he explains.
Working closely with a group of Iceland-based musicians, including producer Young Nazareth, Water is Styled Honey is easily Snny’s most sonically rich project to date, blending U.K. garage drums (“Be Here Now”), funk-flecked guitar licks (“Flying in the Dark”), and sumptuous slow jam R&B (“Yaya’s Interlude”) into something that feels cohesive.'
descr3: "'I’m the happiest and most ambitious I've ever been, I’m embracing growth and instead of obsessing on the things I want, I’m just thoroughly enjoying the process,' he says.
