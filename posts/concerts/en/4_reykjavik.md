descr1: "Darkness. Cold Winds. Glacial landscapes. Isolation. Religion. Oppression and, later, alcohol. A young person stands and faces the future, uncertainty and taxes. Volcanic roars and blistering cold. Social pressure and a longing to belong start weighing down, anxiety rises. Raised in financial stability? A breath of air floats upwards in the shape of a ghost. Where to look? What to think. Are there seeds of vivid and vital social movements on the horizon? Will spring ever come? Last summer was something, what it was though – who knows? Never bring a knife to an all out shoot- out. Power defends power. Systems are designed to protect systems, we know this by now. Young people need optimism! All people need optimism! We need relentless energy, fast paced songs, screeching guitars, guttural harsh voices, bass like sandpaper to the inner ears and drums that keep us marching on the tracks towards optimism and better days. We need R! Reykjavík!"
descr2: "The rock band was mostly functional from 2003-2015. It operated primarily in the greater metropolitan area, while making occasional ventures through Iceland, Europe, North America and Japan. It leaves in its wake three LPs, an EP and a throbbing void in the heart of the city."
