descr1: Curro Rodrígez and Flaaryr (Diego Manatrizio) are two artists based in Reykjavík who have found connecting points in their seemingly very different artistic practices and backgrounds.
descr2: With the shared goal of exploring the primordial states where people and inanimate bodies become hard to tell apart, they created this immersive experience using the most basic elements of stones and voice. Infinite percussive loops build a sonic foundation and meet the deepest voice from flamenco “lo jondo” sometimes in harmonious dialogue and sometimes in a violent clash. The performance happens inside the installation and the installation is the performed instrument itself.
descr3: Flaaryr, born in Argentina in 1993, is an experimental musician in a constant search for new sounds and sources, performing on objects that are not conventionally considered to be instruments. Curro, born in Spain in 1980, is a visual artist that works with nature and the relationship with the human, using ancient flamenco music as a transversal channel to connect these concepts.
