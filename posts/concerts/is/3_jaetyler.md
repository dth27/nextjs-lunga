descr1: "Jae Tyler is"
descr2: 
"ingenious instrumentalist, multi-talented individual, accomplished performer, exciting entertainer, intelligent, eclectic musical genres, exceptional vocalist, virtuoso, experienced, practiced, proficient music"
descr3: 
"and more. With one foot in grunge/90’s alt-rock of yore, and the other in CringeCore/hyper-rock of the future, Jae’s transportive stylings can be described as nothing short of 'Nickelodeon sub-conscious pushed through life’s toxic pipeline'. The performance at LungA will be as a three piece band composed of the prodigious Sólrún Mjöll on drums, and the outstanding Ingibjörg Turchi on bass guitar!"
