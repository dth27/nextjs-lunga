descr1: Lottó burst onto the scene in late 2022 with the single “I’d die to be his wife,” and a subsequent string of performances during the Iceland Airwaves season drew comparisons to everything from the Britpop sensibilities of Pulp to the hypnotic disco grooves of Donna Summer’s “I feel love.” With songs revolving around sensual daydreaming, board game binging, and queer club-hopping, Lottó evokes the atmosphere of an overcrowded house party where people take turns dancing in the kitchen and spilling wine on the bathroom floor.
