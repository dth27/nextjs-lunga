descr1: GRÓA is a energetic art-punk band. Their live-shows are often performance related but their unique, aggressive-melodic, new wave, sounds constantly shine throughout their set, and creates a new world combined with the audience. Gróa's music makes your ass shake, hips wiggle, toes tingle, breasts bounce, whole body grow an ounce.
