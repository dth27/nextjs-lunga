descr1: Dream Wife have come a long way since their 2018 self-titled debut. Their last album, So When You Gonna... smashed the Official UK Top 20 album charts (the only indie album recorded and produced by all women at the time to do so). They've toured internationally, performing at festivals such as Lollapalooza (US), Laneway (AU), Summersonic (JP), Primavera (ES) and Pitchfork (FR) as well as opening for the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park, Garbage, and for The Kills, Sleigh Bells and Sunflower Bean across North America. Their music has appeared on numerous TV soundtracks and theyâ€™ve remixed tracks by Rina Sawayama, Nova Twins, Porridge Radio and more.
