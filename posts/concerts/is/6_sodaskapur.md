descr1: Inviting listeners into the space between a breath and a sound, Sandrayati's music calls us forward to a world that is more enchanted than the one we see and more connected than the one we feel. Her 2023 debut album, "Safe Ground" (Decca), tells of selves rebuilt from a fractured world around them with delicacy and determination, weaving safety out of fear. 
descr2: Born into a tradition of folk music and activism, Sandrayati's music nourishes and nurtures, drawing audiences not only into herself but into one another. She asks us to open the spaces within and collapse the spaces between–a reminder of our shared inheritance on a shared planet.
descr3: Hailed as a Sunday Times Breaking Act, Sandrayati has toured with RY X and Nick Mulvey in Europe and the UK (NME) and has performed recently at The Great Escape (UK) and Iceland Airwaves. She is currently recording her next album in Iceland and New York, a project that will come into the world in three waves, beginning on June 6.
