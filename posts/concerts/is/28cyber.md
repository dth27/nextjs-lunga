descr1:  Even though originally formed in 2012 as a thrash metal/disco concept, CYBER is now known as the ongoing experimental electronic, genre-bending project of Salka Valsdóttir (neonme) and Jóhanna Rakel. The band was named after a lipstick that Salka and Jóhanna both found themselves rocking when they became best friends at sixteen. Releasing 5 projects in the last 5 years, touring all around Europe with the renowned boyband HATARI and opening for the likes of Sevdaliza and Migos, CYBER has now established themselves as a leading force of fun and experimental live performances in Iceland. For their latest album ´VACATION´ CYBER won the Icelandic Music Awards for best hip-hop/rap album of the year 2020. CYBER are set to release their album ‘SAD ;’(‘ in January 2024, a long anticipated record that’s centred around teenage angst.
