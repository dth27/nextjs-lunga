descr1: 'Flesh Machine is an indie/alternative band based in Reykjavík Iceland. They blew up in the underground scene in late 2022. Flesh Machine is the brainchild of Kormákur Jarl Gunnarsson as an expression outlet while he was living and studying in Berlin and as a coping mechanism for his depression and anxiety. After he moved back to Iceland he decided to expand that Idea by adding members and forming a band: Baldur Hjörleifsson and Lukas Zurawski on guitars, Jón G. Breiðfjörð on drums, and Auðunn Orri Sigurvinsson on bass.'
descr2: "The band performed its debut show in August 2022 and has been active in the Reykjavík music scene ever since, always performing for fully-packed venues and festivals including Norðanpaunk and off-venue Iceland Airwaves. The band's first single, released in January 2022, was very well-received and even caught the attention of Anthony Fantano, who hosts the YouTube channel 'The Needle Drop,' giving the single a good review."
descr3: 'The creative world of Flesh Machine draws musical influences from The Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop, Depeche Mode, Brian Eno, Tears for Fears, and David Bowie. The band is also influenced by the creative mind of David Lynch. The essence of Flesh Machine is blending two worlds. The flesh represents warmth, emotion, and humanity, while the Machine represents the cold, mechanism, and synthetic. Blending acoustic and electronic sounds to create music that explores the human experience, depression, and the dark corners of the human psyche.'
