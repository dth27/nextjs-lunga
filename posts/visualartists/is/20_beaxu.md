about1: "Bea Xu (they/she/it) is a Chinese-British psychic worker experimenting with reality production. Using collaborative play, speculative fiction and therapeutic intervention they design and means-test integral, post-Anthropocenic cosmologies with live participants and fellow accomplices. Often foregrounding blood magic, decolonised time and non-binary logic with an EcoGothic focus, their work engages with archetypal shadow and is informed by their training as an integrative, trans-personal psychotherapist."
about2: "They are a part of Long Distance Residency project, where the group will travel by ecological means to exhibit at LungA."
