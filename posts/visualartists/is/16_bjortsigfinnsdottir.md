about1: "Björt Sigfinnsdóttir (artist alias FURA) is a musician and multimedia artist born, raised and based in Seyðisfjörður. Björt has traveled the world with her music for over a decade now but has turned more to visual and performative art in recent years."
about2: "The exhibited works at LungA this year are also her most recent work of 2023 made in Seyðisfjörður and are part of an experimental series with a focus on materiality. Through her performative works, Björt likes to evoke multiple senses at once. In this exhibition, “Embers of splendor”, that translates by her using materials that are tactile and give a multi dimensional sensory experience."
