about2: "Berglind and Ásrún have known each other for over 20 years. Their paths have crossed on many occasions and in many ways  throughout the years. They have seen the world together; visited Central America to research ways of life and ways of eating. Both Berglind and Ásrún are passionate about love and matters of the heart and for this reason they set out on a journey to Mexico in search of a recipe for an ancient love elixir. Recently they visited Paris, the city of love, together, in order to gain insight into the various ways in which French youngsters deal with amour. In all their travels around the world, together and apart, Berglind and Ásrún have used the methods of the letter to keep in touch with each other and loved ones."
