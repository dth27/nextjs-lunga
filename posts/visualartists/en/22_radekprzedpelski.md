artist: "Radek Przedpełski"
exhibition1: 
about1: "Radek Przedpełski (pronounced: rah-deck pshet-pe-oo-skee), (he/him) is a migrant artist-philosopher lecturing in interactive digital media at Trinity College Dublin. Radek's artistic practice revolves around entanglements between the earth, the cosmos, and sustainable artistic techniques. Radek's environments and low-bandwidth video works seek to create a resonant milieu—a site of incantation and speculative world-building inspired by ecologies of the Outer Carpathian Mountains and Éire. Radek graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a PhD in Digital Art and Humanities, focusing on Polish neo-avant-garde of the 1970s."
about2: "Radek co-edited a volume on Deleuze, Guattari and the Art of Multiplicity published by Edinburgh University Press in 2020. He is a member of Substantial Motion Research Network founded by Laura U. Marks and Azadeh Emadi for cross-cultural investigation of media art, as well as a curator, together with Laura U. Marks, of the annual Small File Media Festival hosted by the School for the Creative Arts at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver."
about3: "He is a part of Long Distance Residency project, where the group will travel by ecological means to exhibit at LungA."
