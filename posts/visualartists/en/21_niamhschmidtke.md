artist: "Niamh Schmidtke"
exhibition1: 
about1: "Niamh Schmidtke (she/they) explores the political complications of ‘being green’ by cultivating conversations with the environment, through speculation, audio, ceramics and installations. They examine the relationship between listening and speaking, to consider the kinds of voices that deep time, the sea, or humans could have. These relations critique the utopia of renewable energies, drawing attention to the financial origins of climate crises and use intimacy as a form of decolonise praxis for the future."
about2: "Niamh co-produces the radio show Future Artefacts FM, with artist Nina Davies and are currently working on commissions for Science Gallery International in Berlin, and the Hunt Museum in Ireland. They completed their MFA at Goldsmiths, London with a First Class Honours in 2021 and hold a Fine Art Honours BA from Limerick School of Art and Design (2019)."
