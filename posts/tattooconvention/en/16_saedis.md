artist: "Sædís"
about1: "Sædís is a young artist from the eastfjords of Iceland. She started doing silly little tattoos for her friends just for fun during the summer of 2020 but soon fell in love with the art of it. A year later she started her apprenticeship in Moonstone and has been tattooing there ever since. Her style consists of weird, unique creatures with mischievous character. Her designs are not supposed to be taken too seriously, they are supposed to represent the playful, spirited and lighthearted side of us, when we really just come alive."
