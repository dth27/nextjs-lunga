artist: "Emii"
about1: "Emii grew up in spain but she was born in Iceland. Influenced by many cultures snd styles, she specifies as black and grey, micro realism, traditional and fine line. Though she also enjoys working other styles. She started her career in 2009, since then she has not yet defined her style but always adds her own personal touch to every piece. She is also dedicated to making cover ups and covering scars with beautiful pieces of art, changing the lives of some people. Her experience over the years allows her to use different techniques  and styles, achieving a unique and original result. Love doing customized tattoos as well."
