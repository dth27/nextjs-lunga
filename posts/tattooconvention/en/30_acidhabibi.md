artist: "acid habibi"
about1: "Polish artist living both in Copenhagen and Pozna≈Ñ, well known from living nomadic life. Expressing sensitivity trough drawing, painting, sculpting, tattooing and playing with synthesizers. Sharing a dream life with bear called Chico. Started tattooing almost 10 years ago and clearly existing in tattoo scene for 7 years. Collaborated with different ppl in different art fields since 2016. Took part of many festivals and events in Poland as well as outside of the country. Amazed by nature perfection and driven by her infinite imagination and what has not yet been discovered, she puts her ideas on paper, drawing creatures from out of this world and devoting herself to abstract patterns. With an unconventional approach, she always tries to create a unique relationship from which unrepeatable project emerges during the session. Always appreciates human interactions and is open to various perspectives."
