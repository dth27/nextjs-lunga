about1: "I'm a musical artist , who started their journey in tattooing in early 2024, im now going under the moniker’Untamed Youth’ for this new path in my journey! I draw my inspiration from similar places to where i draw from for my music. That is cinema, music, poetry, my own lyrics, nature, surrealism and parties. As a musical artist I played at LungA last year in 2023 which left me deep in love with the festival and Iceland. I'm honoured to be one of LungA's Artists in Residence for 2024 as well as a tattooist at the convention. My style is fine lines sketch-like drawings, using solely black and red inks. I am normally based in London, but lucky enough to travel the world for music and art!"
