artist: "HopingNoPolice"
about1: "I'm an underground artist born and raised in Reykjav√≠k. I've had a keen interest in all things artistic since early childhood which developed into a passion for graffiti and drawings by the age of ten. My love of graffiti eventually had me seek out an art school which then led me to discover the world of tattoos few years ago. I started out doing a lot of blackwork, ignorant style, and traditional style tattoos but have constantly been developing my style as the years go on. I draw a lot of inspiration from my regular travels through mainland Europe, with the techno, rave and graffiti scenes being the biggest contributors to my art. I hope you enjoy exploring my work at LungA."
