descr1: LOVE letters to go, Ásrún Mjöll and Berglind Erna welcome visitors and pedestrians to the Gamla Sýslumannshúsið in Seyðisfjörður. There you can have their assistance and facilities to write a love letter to ease your heart or request a special love letter to pass on written by them. The letters, written and unwritten, will be typewritten on the finest paper and richly decorated by the artists.
descr2: The residential place, Gamla Sýslumannshúsið will have a romantic atmosphere where participants can sit both outside and inside if the weather permits, read books about love and seek inspiration. We encourage people to experience the nostalgia that comes with sneaking a letter into the mailbox, but love certainly also sometimes comes with sadness, and we offer that guests can burn the letters they order, responsibly and safely. Love is multifaceted!
