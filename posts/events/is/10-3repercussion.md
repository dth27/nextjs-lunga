name: you know a repercussion when you feel one (Ada M. Patterson)
type: Sýning
where: Heima
descr1: "you know a repercussion when you feel one offers a gathering of kanga textiles and video works by Ada M. Patterson. Kanga is a wearable printed textile popular in East Africa, featuring a border, a central image and a proverb. Kanga, through its message, can pray, prophesy, wish, warn, protect, or even curse. They are usually gifted to someone for whom their message resonates. Ada M. Patterson started making kanga during Hurricane Dorian (2019). It is a practice gifted to her by her mother. Kanga for the Present considers the ways kanga, as a performative and visual intersection between image-making, textiles, clothing, poetry and communication, can make room to support the voices of those who struggle to speak in times that are difficult to speak to. "  
descr2: "Nestled between the hanging kanga textiles, is a reel of two video works. One video work, you know a repercussion when you feel one, offers a conversation on breath, voice, sound and music. In this work, two mouths discuss their changing relationships to making sounds and using their voices. Each mouth is framed by an outline, echoing the shapes of notes found in double second steel pans; an instrument of harmony and countermelody. How might we live at our loudest? When do we feel most listened to? What do we need for our voices to carry? you know a repercussion when you feel one considers what it means to speak back and be heard."
