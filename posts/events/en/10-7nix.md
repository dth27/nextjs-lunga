descr1: "Mythologies of self, identity, and transformation. Nix  is a slip into the void, 
an embodied state of bliss exploring ones own shadows through rituals of intimacy and surrender."
descr2: "Enter the void, the three descendants of Nix , Urðr – who represents that which was, Verðandi – that which is in the state of becoming, and Skuld – that which shall be. The work is a third in a series of scripts based on structures of consent and pleasure activism."
