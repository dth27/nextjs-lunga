descr1: Bliss as a point of departure, encompasses the capacity for change, a destination of sorts and all the stages of transit. It lies within these moments when our minds and hearts alike expand to nestle people and ideas that move us forward, accelerate us. Once there, it becomes a driving force in us that, although language at times falls short of apprehending, expresses itself by embracing the remnants and braves new beginnings.
descr2: "In the coexistence of reflection on things that matter to us and the need to nourish and be nourished resides the capacity to intrinsically take action. At times, subjects that make us feel at unease may spring up. Discourse on collective and personal rebirth, process, recollection and questioning the-way-things-were enable us to build on the potentialities of what could be - knowledge is Bliss, like a sigh of relief and the rejoicing that follows. "
descr3: "It is an ongoing progress we strive for, every so often encountering along the way limitations and holding on to ideas - yet also cherishing fellow travelers, telling the stories that should not be forgotten, queering the narratives, grieving and finding resolutions, embracing the ambiguity, taking all the risks, changing the world, appreciating the journey."
