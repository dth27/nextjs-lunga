date: 10–16 July
time: '17.00–20.00 / 12.00–20.00 (Closed on Thu)'
name: The Messengers (Á. Birna Björnsdóttir)
type: Exhibition
where: Stálstjörnur’s backyard / Sæti bus (Smyril Line parking lot)
descr1: Rendering sunlight into sound waves, the messengers hang on the windows emitting clicks that fall onto the ground like the raindrops outside the windows. As the sun peeks out from behind a cloud, the solar choir fills up the bus with clumsy tones that need to tell, yell and remind of the things that cannot be overlooked. I overlook. I look over without seeing a thing but my body knows before I do. 
descr2: It’s the translating of the message that takes ages. I wish I could just jump on a bus that would take me there, to my body. Or drive down on a pickup truck, radio blasting, with all my baggage piled on the back. 
descr3:
note: Please respect the opening hours and do not walk through Stál Stjörnur’s private plot outside of the opening hours.
