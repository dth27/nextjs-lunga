title: 'Fró(u)n: How to make love to the ground we live on?'
teacher1: Elín Margot
teacher2: Antonía Berg
about1: How can we express love for the ground we live on? How do we recognize the living body of nature, acknowledge its untamed value, and give it agency within our human societies? We propose a shift in the narrative of personification. Instead of speaking, thinking, and interacting with an Earth-mother, we prefer the idea of an Earth-lover—an entity that gives and cares as much as it desires to be loved and cared for. It's a passionate love story between humans and non-human entities such as fjords, mountains, seas, and all the characters that compose our wild environment.
about2: 'For LungA, Antonía Berg and Elín Margot invite workshop participants to deeply engage with Fró(u)n and connect with Seydisfjördur’s nature in a radical way: by creating ways to make love with it!'
about3: 'Fró(u)n is a play on words—frón, an old word for Iceland, and fróun, the Icelandic word for masturbation. It serves as the title of their research project where Antonía and Elín create pleasure objects using clay from the fjord of Berunes, embodying the place in tangible artefacts enabling intimate interactions.'
about4: 'For a week, we will consider Seydisfjöður as our lover—a unique landscape with its own temperament and charismatic characteristics. Participants will have the opportunity to meet their sweetheart and intimately acquaint themselves through foraging walks where they will collect natural raw materials to use in their projects. Local clay will be our primary medium, supplemented by what participants find compelling. Through readings and discussions, we will collectively reflect on the current state of our human relationship with nature. We will work with the elements, transform and solidify our journeys with a bonfire firing clay. At last, each participant will develop individual or collective ways to interact with the fjord, rooted in reciprocal love.'
aboutteacher1: 'Elín Margot is a designer, researcher and educator currently Programme Director of the BA Product Design at the Iceland University of the Arts. Her design practice focuses on creating objects and situations that question our day-to-day and explore alternative ecological and ethical futures. She uses the narrative power of objects to confront users to disruptive ideologies and immerse them in a potential tomorrow. She (re)designs mundane things such as forks and knives with a behavioral and/or technological twist asking what if? Elín Margot studied product design and social design in France and graduated from the MA Exploration & Translation at the Iceland University of the Arts in 2019. Since then, she has contributed to diverse design projects across France, Iceland, and Denmark, alongside exhibiting self-initiated research and teaching design in multiple academic institutions. Notably, she co-founded the food and art platform MÁL/TÍÐ and the sustainable design and art festival RUSL FEST. Her recent focus lies in reshaping Western narratives surrounding nature. Collaborating with Antonía Berg on the project Fró(u)n, they propose to consider  fjords as lovers. Similarly, in her project Interspecies Mothering, Elín invites participants to view whole colonies of yeasts and bacterias as family, and to adopt them as their daughters.'
aboutteacher2: "Antonía Bergþórsdóttir is a ceramicist and artist, founder of FLÆÐI art gallery, and MÓR an accessible ceramic studio in hafnar.haus.She forms one half of the fine art duo Augnablikin alongside Íris María Leifsdóttir. Elín Margot and her work together on the project Fró(u)n crafting sensual objects from Porcelain and Berunes clay, aiming to foster a more intimate bond with nature, reimagining it as a lover rather than a mother. She studied Pottery at the Visual School of Art in Reykjavík and graduated in 2020. During an internship in France in 2019, she studied porcelain, plaster making and design. Antonía specialises in utilising raw materials, particularly those sourced from her immediate environment, embarking on material exploration journeys since 2018, including investigating glacial clay in Greenland and Iceland. Her interest lies in leveraging local resources to create sustainable and meaningful creations, advocating for a hands-on approach to materials to deepen one's connection to craftsmanship and the natural world.  Currently, she collaborates with Sei architect studio in designing the Icelandic brick. Antonía has an extensive portfolio comprising solo exhibitions, group showcases, lectures, workshops, and events both domestically and internationally."
