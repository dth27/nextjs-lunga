title: The Shoulders We Stand On
teacher1: Clementine Edwards
length: 5 day workshop
about1: What stories do we narrate and what meanings do we make when we read a text? And what do these stories and meanings tell us about our implication in the world?  
about2: The Shoulders We Stand On is a workshop about honouring and amplifying our references. In this expanded reading group, we journey through the thickets of the who, what, how and the why we read.   We come together at LungA under the banner of bliss. Black feminist thinking has been central to much of bliss’s politics. But if we are not Black women/femmes ourselves, it’s easy to neglect how and why Black feminist thinking came into being – to take the easy/appealing bits and leave the rest behind.
about3: Over five glorious days we’re going to think into citation as storytelling and as political practice. We’ll start by getting to know one another and the art practice of Ada M. Patterson, whose exhibition space we will gather in and whose work we will revel in. Learning from disability justice, we’ll make a collective access document. From there the horizons open up to us. Participants will encounter thought-provoking texts on Black trans feminism; navigate and discuss ways of reading expansively; get familiar with key decolonising research methods written by Indigenous scholars; and begin compiling their own personal reader that cites the writers they love and loves the writers they cite. 
aboutteacher1: 'Clementine Edwards (they/them) is a Rotterdam-based artist who works across sculpture, writing,
performance and film. Clementine’s ongoing research line is material kinship, which thinks
material beyond extraction and kinship beyond the biological family. Craft, world-building and
intimacy are integral to Clementine’s practice, as are the themes of toxic inheritances,
climate crisis and queer grief, and how lived experience, including trauma, narrates
meaning-making. It asks: How to honour, remember and enchant the worlds that we are
immersed in, and the contexts that shape us, nourish us and resist us?'
aboutteacher2: In 2022 Clementine was a Gerrit Rietveld Academy Fellow in the Jewellery - Linking Bodies department and published The Material Kinship Reader, co-edited with Kris Dittel.
