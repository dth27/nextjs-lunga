title: Poetics of VJing
teacher1: Carla Zimbler
length: 5 day workshop
about1: VJing is the art of manipulating imagery in real-time. It involves embracing the emotional energy of a song or atmospherics of a space and creating a complementary visual environment as a gestural, artistic response. As an exploratory, improvised performance it can be a liberating tool for expression and set a desired mood/tone via colour, pacing and digital abstraction. In this workshop we will investigate the tools needed to enhance immersive stage productions through projection mapping, spatial design and live mixing. We will deep dive into programs such as VDMX5 and MadMapper and build our own poetic sculptural installations to bring to life with video and light. More than just a ‘visual jockey,’ learn how to stitch, weave and blend stories together across custom surfaces. We will examine both analogue + digital methods, stylistic effects and aesthetics that work best for each workshop participant’s needs and artistic outcomes. Come play, mix and map together in a fun, inclusive and imaginative space. Join as an individual or duo. Everyone is welcome with no prior knowledge necessary.
about2: Students are encouraged to bring their own video cameras and laptops that are capable of running graphics-intensive, MAC-based software.

aboutteacher1: Carla Zimbler (she/her) bends light across architecture and soaks sculptural forms in vivid textures as a live performative experience. Her installations explore fluidity to shift perspective and redefine spatial, spiritual and emotional boundaries, acting as both conduit and gateway to the otherworldly.
aboutteacher2: Utilising experimental film, photogrammetry and generative 3D software to explore various phenomena, bodies are drawn into immersive spaces where sound-responsive visuals expand, burst and dissolve. The intimate, experiential world-building elements of her practice ebb and flow between the familiar and uncanny, navigating digitally modified ecosystems in a lucid dream-like state.
aboutteacher3: Carla’s visual work has been featured at Sydney Opera House, National Gallery of Australia, VIVID Sydney, Reykjavík Winter Lights Festival, List i Ljosi, Distortion Ø, World Pride and Sydney Biennale.
