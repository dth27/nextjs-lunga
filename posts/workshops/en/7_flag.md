title: 'Raising a flag'
teacher1: Salka Gullbrá
about1: "Inspired by the impact of when the flag of Palestine was raised in Seyðisfjörður last winter in solidarity with Palestine, eventually leading to the municipality demanding it be taken down , this performative workshop works with themes of resistance, repression and direct action. We’ll explore different methods of making trouble and resisting, be they throwing rocks or glitter, taking naps or yelling into a megaphone."
aboutteacher1: "Salka Gullbrá is an Icelandic theater and performance maker, stand-up comedian and activist, and these practices all connect in her work. She is the founder and artistic director of Krakkaveldi (e.Kidarchy), a performance project where she collaborates with children to create a world where children rule everything instead of adults, challenging the power dynamics between kids and adults. Kidarchy’s performances have been featured at the Reykjavík Art Festival, Reykjavik Dance Festival and at LungA!"
aboutteacher2: "For the past months, she’s been working as project manager for the Iceland-Palestine Association. She’s also the lead singer of punk band Stormy Daniels. Salka is interested in exploring how to use art in activism and vice versa, finding what’s funny about serious concerns she has and making trouble wherever possible."
