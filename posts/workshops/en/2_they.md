title: They removed a plank of wood from their pocket
teacher1: Tara & Silla
length: 5 day workshop
about1: They removed a plank of wood from their pocket, is a five-day performance workshop led by the duo Tara and Silla.
about2: In the workshop we will work fast and slow, share good and bad ideas, let curiosity guide us, share our inspirations, celebrate letting go of sole authorship, find freedom in amateurism, talk about what excites us about performance, explore how moments between old and new friends can become material for performance, go on adventures, read together, investigate simple gestures, complicate simple acts, practice active listening, and welcome ways of togetherness in art making.
about3: Through the week we will dive into the essence of performance using conversation as a tool and wood as our trusty material. We will put together our planks to get over the stream. Wood is hard but also soft, alive and almost eternal, performances are magically fleeting but tables live forever..*
