aboutteacher1: Viðar Logi (he/him) is a self-taught photographer and video artist. His work revolves around keen investigation of figurative forms, presented in a way that challenges the viewer’s perceptions of reality. His photography style is defined by nuanced manipulations of proportion and figure-ground, achieved with a hybrid of analog and digital techniques that often involve handmade or improvised equipment. Notably, Logi has collaborated with musician Björk, crafting her album cover and directing three music videos. Logi’s image-making is in direct dialogue with the surreal landscapes from his upbringing in the northernmost tip of Iceland. He articulates a vision that invites the viewer to travel within.
aboutteacher2: Jón Albert (he/him) is a multi-material visual outsider artist. His works are based on the emotional relations and the expression between oneself and the works. He holds a degree in dressmaking and is therefore a seamstress, working on costume design for art projects and commissions, as well as everyday wear. Quintessentially, he seeks to source and employ a variety of materials in any project, fascinated by the many functions and purposes behind each item.
