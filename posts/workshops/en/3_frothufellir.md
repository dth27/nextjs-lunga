Together we will work our way through a creative process, sketches, games and get to know various materials and methods of working. Emphasis will be placed on promoting personal expression and D.I.Y. (do it yourself) working methods. The workshop will close with an opening of an exhibition in LungA’s Family Zone on July 20th."

A detailed program will be sent to participants closer to date. Participation fee is 25.000 ISK. Included in the fee is the workshop itself, a light snack and a ticket for the LungA Festival Concert."
