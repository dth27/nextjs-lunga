title: 'Vibrating Bodies of Water Across Time'
teacher1: Jack Armitage
teacher2: Hayden Dunham
about1: "Vibrating Bodies of Water Across Time is a workshop led by Jack Armitage and Hayden Dunham that examines the capacity of water to connect disparate timelines and lifetimes, and unite selves past, present and future. The water within us, and the water that surrounds us, is both ancient and new. Sometimes it is held for millions of years inside rocks underground, only to resurface and vaporise into the atmosphere, or condense onto a leaf. The bodies of this earth, including our own, are water in essence, and amplifying and reverberating them can lead to profound transformations."
about2: "Together we will deepen our awareness of and kinship with vibrating bodies of water across time, through practices taking inspiration from astral travel, quantum leaping, moving timelines, inner child and future self work, death as an opening, failure as a practice, and rewilding the self."
