teacher1: Elisabeth Nienhuis
teacher2: Algleidy Zerpa
teacher3: Alfredo Flores
# length: 5 day workshop
about1: "Snákur’s Sleepover is a theatre experiment. During our time together this week, we'll use our storytelling, writing, and music creation to grapple with the sometimes painful realities of our world.*"
about2: "Drawing inspiration from our personal, political, and poetic selves, we'll try out various writing prompts, storytelling and transmission techniques, theater exercises, and singing exercises. Our magic will be in the doing."
about3: "This workshop is led by participants from the theater performance ‘Snákur’, who developed this welcoming practice from their own artistry and experiences as asylum seekers or refugees. We'll create from a supportive space where all experiences and ideas are valued, especially those that aren't usually listened to.Everyone is welcome, and no prior experience is needed. Snákur’s Sleepover, is led by Elisabeth Nienhuis, Algleidy Zerpa and Alfredo Flores."
about4: "*If you feel overwhelmed by this mix of activities, or the world, that's okay – we are too! We experienced that combining elements of these practices will strengthen our little floating community and help us grow as artists."
aboutteacher1: 'Elisabeth Nienhuis (she/her) is an actor and theater maker who creates explosive moments of togetherness with strangers, family and friends. She is forever interested in the act of welcoming  yourself – into whatever is lacking. She graduated from the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp in 2023 and works in Brussels on productions with her mother, drug dealers and kids with absent families.'
aboutteacher2: "Algleidy Zerpa (she/her) is an architect, multidisciplinary artist and kindergarten worker. She loves to create bonds with humans, sound waves, kids, technology, words, the sea and the rocks that it gives us."
aboutteacher3: "Alfredo Flores (he/his) is a musician and artist from Venezuela. He has experience in developing events and festivals for the expression of arts in his city. He always gives his best and his energy to make things happen."
aboutteacher4: "Together, they have worked with Borgarleikhús theatre and the Red Cross to create Snákur.
Snákur is about the courageous act of reaching out. In times of ongoing world-ache, many of us have to adapt to a new place to live. The desire for social inclusion (read: to belong, to have friends, to get invited to an effing party)!
For that reason, a bunch of brave people from all ages and places explored the act of welcoming yourself into society, instead of waiting for it to magically happen."
