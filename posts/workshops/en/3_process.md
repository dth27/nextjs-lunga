title: (it's) we're all part of the process
teacher1: Eric, Heidi, Sara
length: 5 day workshop
about1: Our workshop reckons humans’ standing in a changing natural world. We frame this collaborative experience in the context of the climate crisis and local natural disasters stemming from this global issue. During the workshop, we will find first-hand evidence of past and potential future disasters that impact the fjord, including landslides, avalanche, and sea-level rise. To address the impacts of these disasters, including mental health consequences, eco-anxiety, and eco-grief, we will use our bodies and minds to explore our place in the world and our relationships with fellow humans and the more-than-human. This exploration will be supplemented with discussions and activities based on the importance of place in learning and relationships. From this common understanding, we will create visual and performative works that speak to the place and what we bring to it. Our creative process, which will include body movement, found object art, and community mapping, will allow us to achieve an interdisciplinary understanding of earth that is a crucially rare resource in forging a path forward for ourselves and future generations. We hope to find clarity and calm in an otherwise uncertain world.
