title: 'Handmade Video'
teacher1: Abigail Portner
about1: "Handmade Video: In a world now dependent on technology, computers, phones, it's important to continue to make things by hand, even video content!"
about2: "In this workshop we will be making things like puppets, masks, and cut out paper animations. You will have the freedom to choose what form of handmade fits you with the supplies given, or using elements from nature or repurposed objects found around the fjord. Once we have all created a character, an animal or pattern, we will shoot a short collaborative video directed by you, combining all the elements we have created. This video will then be used to showcase your work in a screening in the festival!"
