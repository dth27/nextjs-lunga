about1: "Do you enjoy dancing? Do you like music? Are you interested in feminism?"
about2: "This year we invite youth (15-21 years old) to participate in the workshop Feminist Rave. The workshop draws inspiration from rave culture and is a feminist utopia where all are free to express themselves and move as they wish to music of their own choice. During a week-long workshop, participants will experiment within dance, DJ-ing and scenography. Together they will create a new dance piece, an epic rave where all feel safe regardless of gender expression, style of dancing or manner of dressing. "
about3: "Participants can choose between 3 roles: dancers, DJs or scenographers. Previous experience is not required. The work will be performed for a public audience at the end of the week."
