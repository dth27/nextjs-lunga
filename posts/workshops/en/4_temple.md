title: Temple of Ultimate Bliss
teacher1: Aoibheann Greenan
teacher2: Anto López Espinosa
length: 5 day workshop
about1: Temple of Ultimate Bliss is a performative workshop led by Aoibheann Greenan and Anto López Espinosa (A_A) that will explore collective myth-making as a radical, embodied form of artistic practice, enabling the imagination and temporary inhabitation of alternate realities. The workshop is an invitation to dream, play and co-create a vision that is not yet in existence. A_A will facilitate the myth-making process through practical activities, enriched by the ideas and input of the participants, in a supportive and experimental atmosphere.  
about2: The ‘Temple’, as both motif and metaphor, will form the central axis of our collective mythology. It will activate the emergence of an imaginary community with invented rituals performed through any combination of images, texts, artefacts, garments, video and soundscapes. The Temple will serve as a living archive of our collaboration and together we will imagine how to transmit and weave this shared experience into the fabric of the festival.
aboutteacher1: Aoibheann Greenan (she/her) is an Irish artist working across moving image, live performance, installation, sculpture, costume and drawing. Her projects probe our complicity with capitalist systems of control by pulling at the seams of our increasingly designed experiences. Coercive mechanisms become amplified within theatrical scenographies that deliberately mediate the viewer’s attention. Strange loops emerge across consumer culture, biological processes and esotericism, eliciting  patterns of thought and behavior that persist throughout time. Greenan is a co-founder of the artist collective East London Cable.
aboutteacher2: Anto López Espinosa (she/her) is a performance-based artist, whose work focuses on inhabiting, generating, exposing and proposing their own poetics of transness. Anto often uses sound, their own body and lip syncing as means to explore the format of story-telling in relation to notions of belonging and love. “Lip syncing to my own voice allows me to be multiple and ever changing versions of myself, whether these are located in the past, in the present, or the future; in the real or in the imaginary”.
